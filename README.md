## Development Process

### Timeframe & Working Team

<strong>Timeframe:</strong> This project was built in 6 days. 

<strong>Team:</strong> This is a solo project built by: <b>Neha Bhole</b> [üì®](mailto:nehasbhole@gmail.com)

### Technology Used
Technologies used for this project are: 
- MongoDB Atlas Cloud Database
- Express
- NodeJS
- Materialize CSS 
- Deployed on Railway App

### Planning Process

#### Brief
Project requirements:

- Build a full-stack CRUD app with Node, Express, and MongoDB
- App should have at least 2 data entities with full-CRUD data operations
- Deploy app 
- Optionally use OAuth authentication, consume a third-party API, or expose its own API that returns data resources as JSON

#### Wireframes
The wireframes have been developed using Figma and can be accessed through the link provided below.

### Build/Code Process

#### BackEnd

<!-- BackEnd Sections -->
##### Architecture

The backend system is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern using Node.js and Express.js. This architecture separates the application into three interconnected components: the Model (which handles data and business logic), the View (which presents the data to the user), and the Controller (which handles user input and interacts with both the Model and View).

##### Database 
The project uses MongoDB Atlas as the database for storing data. 

The database for this project includes four models: Category, Link, User, and Favourite. 

Categories and Links have a many-to-many relationship. Each category can have multiple links associated with it and each link can belong to multiple categories. The Category schema is referenced in the Link schema so that links can be queried independently. 

Users and Favourites have a one-to-many relationship, as Favourites will only be queried if a User is defined.

##### Authentication

Users can authenticate themselves using their Google account. The following authentication flow has been implemented in the project:

- The user clicks on the "Login" button, which redirects them to the Google authentication page.
- The user enters their Google account credentials to sign in.
- Once the user is authenticated, they are redirected back to the web app with their user information stored in a session.
- The user can access the web app and perform actions based on their privileges.
- The user can click on the "Logout" button to end their session and log out of the web app.

The authentication is implemented using Google OAuth, and the code for the authentication routes can be found in the index.js file in the routes folder. 

The passport.authenticate() method is used to initiate the authentication flow with Google OAuth. The successRedirect parameter is used to redirect the user to the home page once they are authenticated. The failureRedirect parameter is used to redirect the user to an error page in case the authentication fails.

Once the user is authenticated, their information is stored in the req.user object, which is used to render the appropriate view based on the user's privileges. If the user is an admin, they will have additional privileges, and their isAdmin property will be set to true.

### Future Implementations 
Here are some ideas for future improvements and features that could be added to the app:
- Complete the favourites feature
- Improve styling and user interface
- Make it responsive
- Add link previews
- Add keyword search
- Track hits to a category and link to display top 5
